🚀 Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or higher

pip package manager

Step-by-Step Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/brain-tumor-classification.git
cd brain-tumor-classification
Create a virtual environment (recommended):

bash
python -m venv brain_tumor_env
source brain_tumor_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: brain_tumor_env\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

💻 Usage
Basic Training and Evaluation
Run the complete pipeline with default settings:

bash
python brain_tumor_classification.py
Custom Configuration
Modify the Config class in the script to adjust parameters:

python
class Config:
    BASE_DIR = './your_custom_data_path'  # Change data directory
    IMG_SIZE = (224, 224)                 # Adjust image size
    BATCH_SIZE = 16                       # Modify batch size
    NUM_EPOCHS = 30                       # Change training epochs
    # ... other parameters
Step-by-Step Execution
The script automatically performs these steps:

Data Loading: Loads and preprocesses MRI images

Data Augmentation: Appies transformations to training data

Model Training: Trains the hybrid model with validation

Evaluation: Tests the model on unseen data
